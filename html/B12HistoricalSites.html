        <h1 style="text-align:center;"> Bumbungan Dua Belas or House of Twelve Roofs</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Bumbungan Dua Belas is a museum that translates to the “House of Twelve Roofs”, which used to be the official residence of high British and local officials. It was built in 1906 and today is considered a well-preserved specimen of a rare type of wooden architecture. The roof is made of wooden shingles, the floor of Kapor wood and the entire house of timber that was imported from Sandakan, Sabah. Located about 3 kilometers away from the capital city, the wooden house was strategically built on top of a hillside for a majestic view of Brunei River and Kampong Ayer. <br/><br/>
        The house exhibits old photographs, documents and artifacts that represent past relationships with the British, which date back to the 19th century. The oldest photographers on display where taken in 1907 and 1914. They prove that the house had gone through very little changes through the years. The original Bubungan Dua Belas only had two rooms.

        <h1 style="text-align:center;"> Galleries of Bubungan Dua Belas </h1>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>The exhibition displays some of the photographs depicting the cordial relationship between Brunei and the United Kingdom since late 19th century until present time. The photographs also show how Brunei developed during the resident era and the many changes since independence in 1984. </p><br/><br/>

          <h2>Bumbung Dua Belas is divided into five galleries:</h2><br/>

           <h2>Gallery A: History and Development</h2> <br/><br/><br/>
         <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/11.jpg"/></div>
        <br/>

        <p>The exhibits include the history of the building, its occupants and the resident period of Brunei Darussalam. It also shows the period photographs of Bumbungan Dua Belas’s history including a list with pictures of a century of British Residents and High Commissioners in Brunei Darussalam. </p><br/><br/>

        <h2>Gallery B: Royal and State Visits</h2> <br/><br/><br/> 

         <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/12.jpg"/></div>
        <br/>

        <p>Over 90 years after McArthur links between Brunei Darussalam and the United Kingdom strengthened further. The friendships are shown several royal and state visits made between two countries beginning the early 20th century. </p><br/><br/>


         <h2>Gallery C: Maps and Charts of Brunei Darussalam</h2> <br/><br/><br/> 

        <p>This gallery exhibits maps and charts documenting Brunei Darussalam’s socio-economic and political growth over the last century. The maps and charts displayed contribute to the history of the country, marking how the land has changed as Brunei Darussalam has developed. Many of the maps have come from Royal Geographical Society records in the United Kingdom</p><br/><br/>

        <h2>Gallery D: Centre for British Teachers, the British Council and University Brunei Darussalam</h2> <br/><br/><br/> 

         <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/13.jpg"/></div>
        <br/>

        <p>These three combined institutions provide an interesting exhibition on Brunei Darussalam – United Kingdom relationships through the educational programmes. The British Council Exhibit shows how the relationship between two countries has entered the future using cutting edge technology to create more connections. <br/><br/>


        As Bumbungan Dua Belas is one of the oldest surviving buildings in Brunei Darussalam and also very rare example of wooden architecture so visitors are allowed to visit this building once they are in Brunei Darussalam. </p><br/><br/>
